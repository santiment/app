          Although it’s still very new, we keep finding new ways that you can use our list to{' '}
          <b>keep up with the crypto crowd or inform your trading decisions.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>1. Get a 1-minute overview of the biggest (developing) stories in crypto</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a lot of noise on crypto social media daily, and dozens of minor or irrelevant
          stories published on crypto news sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our list filters out this noise to only <b>show what sticks</b>, and eliminate topics and
          narratives that didn’t get the crowd’s attention. It crowns the ‘social winners’ and weeds
          out ‘social losers’ so you can <b>pinpoint</b> where the community focus lies at any
          point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our list also often picks up on important stories that fly <b>under the radar</b> of major
          crypto publications.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when Afri Schoeden, one of Ethereum long-standing devs was accused of
          conflict of interest and denounced by the Ethereum community across major crypto
          subreddits, the story showed up on our list <b>days</b> before any news outlet reported on
          it. If you want to discover grassroots crypto narratives before they turn mainstream,
          bookmark our list ASAP.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Spot local tops and hype peaks</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          In our experience so far, we found that a coin ticker’s appearance on the list can be a
          fairly effective top indicator.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the coin is already in an uptrend, its presence on our Top 10 list might signal that a
          local top is nearing, as the hype around the coin reaches its peak.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of many examples is Waves, which topped our list back on December 19th, 2018, at
          exactly the time its price hit a 6-month high:
        </p>
        <img

          alt='Waves in trends page'
          className={styles.img}
        />
        <img

          alt='Waves in project page'
          className={styles.img}
        />
        <p>
          Soon after hitting ‘peak hype’, the price of Waves began trending downwards, and has
          failed to recapture that local top since:
        </p>
        <img
          src='https://api-stage.santiment.net/images/sanbase/TrendsHelpPopup/chart.png'

          className={styles.img}
        />

        <p>
          One of our community members shared how he’s already made our list a part of his swing
          trading strategy:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            “There were strong enough signals about LUN from my scanner to begin paying attention to
            Santiment dashboards on the 18th. On the 21st, Sanbase metrics offered a positive RR, so
            I entered there. Then, <b>late on the 22nd, LUN showed up on the Top 10 list</b>, so I
            started to seek an exit. It arrived late on the 23rd, as the crowd really started
            talking about LUN.”
          </i>
        </p>

        <img
          src='https://api-stage.santiment.net/images/sanbase/TrendsHelpPopup/chart-and-arrows.png'
          alt='Waves in project page'
          className={styles.img}
        />
        <p>
          That said, <b>not every hype peak</b> (during an uptrend) = an impending price retraction.
          For example, the recent increase in mentions of RCN on crypto social media correlated to
          (what turned out to be) a first leg of a prolonged rally:
        </p>
        <img
          src='https://api-stage.santiment.net/images/sanbase/TrendsHelpPopup/social.png'
          alt='Waves in project page'
          className={styles.img}
        />
        <img
          src='https://api-stage.santiment.net/images/sanbase/TrendsHelpPopup/trend-explore.png'
          alt='Waves in project page'
          className={styles.img}
        />

        <p>
          This is why it’s always a good idea to combine our list with other indicators and do your
          own research to get a better idea of why the crowd has suddenly gained interest in a coin.
