          Other than the actual words, our list has 5 columns that help bring more context to the
          results:
        </p>
        <div className={styles.blockItem}>
          <p>
            <b>Hype Score</b> - this is the main criteria for ranking the words on our list. The
            Hype Score is based on a sophisticated formula (developed by Santiment) that analyzes
            all social media messages, and then - using a dozen parameters - ranks the words by the{' '}
            <b>likelihood of sustained chatter.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The bigger the Hype Score, the more likely it is that a particular word/topic will
            continue to be discussed in the near future, whereas a lower Hype Score means that
            although a word/topic is very popular in crypto at the moment, it’s already slowly
            losing the crowd’s attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Social Volume shows the absolute number of social mentions for each word, the Hype
            Score is much more complex and actually tries to predict which of the top 10 words are
            more likely to continue to be talked about on crypto social media, and which are
            starting to fizzle out.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.blockItem}>
          <b>Social Volume</b> - shows the total amount of mentions of a word/topic on crypto social
          media today. The (green or red) number next to it shows how many (more or less) social
          media mentions the word has had today compared to yesterday.
        </div>
        <div className={styles.blockItem}>
          <Icon type='connection-big' className={styles.icon} /> - shows if some words on our list
          are related, i.e. trending for the same reason. Hovering over the Link icon will highlight
          all the related words on the list.
          <p>
            The words are linked together whenever someone writes a Community Insight about them.
            Anyone can do it - here’s how:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              On the main{' '}
              <Link to={'/labs/trends'} className={styles.link}>
                Trends
              </Link>{' '}
              page, tick the words on the list that you believe are trending for the same reason
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you’ve selected the related words, click “+ Add Insight” found right below the
              list.
            </li>
            <li>Write an Insight explaining why those words are trending together</li>
            <li>
              Once you publish your insight, those words will be publicly interlinked on our list,
              and hovering over the Link symbol will highlight the related words for everyone
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.blockItem}>
          <p>
            <Icon className={styles.icon} type='insight' /> - shows if there are any Community
            Insights written about a particular trending word.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever someone selects one or more words on the list and writes an Insight about them
            (see above), the Paper icon will display a number in the top right corner. That number
            indicates how many Insights have been written in connection to that term.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.blockItem}>
          <p>
            <Icon className={styles.icon} type='cloud-big' /> - clicking the Cloud icon opens the
            social Word Cloud for a selected word, which gives you additional information about why
            it’s trending.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cloud highlights terms that are often used alongside the selected word on crypto
            social media (in the past 3 days). Larger terms in the cloud are found more frequently
            in connection to the selected word.
