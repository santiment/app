          This list does NOT calculate the most popular words on crypto social media <b>overall</b>{' '}
          - those would often be the same, redundant words such as ‘Bitcoin’, ‘Ethereum’, ‘crypto’
          etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, our list aims to discover the biggest <b>developing</b> or <b>emerging</b>{' '}
          stories within the crypto community. That is why each day you’ll see a new batch of fresh
          topics, currently gaining steam on crypto social media.
        </p>

        <p>
          To do this, every 9 hours we calculate the top 10 words with the biggest spike in social
          media mentions compared to their average social volume in the previous 2 weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          This signals an abnormally high interest in a previously uninspiring topic, making the
          list practical for discovering new and developing talking points in the crypto community.
        </p>

        <p>
          The results are sourced from more than 1000 crypto-specific social media channels,
          including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>300+ Telegram groups</li>
          <li>300+ crypto subreddits</li>
          <li>BitcoinTalk</li>
          <li>More social channels constantly being added</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The Santiment team also writes a detailed daily breakdown of the top 10 words to explain
          their appearance on the list. You can find our daily reports on the{' '}
