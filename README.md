2. Run Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container... through command palette (F1 or Cmd-Shift-P)

## Local development (under HTTPS)

To start your local development you need to:
1. Whitelist your domain
   1. Open `/etc/hosts`
   2. Add the following line: `127.0.0.1 local.santiment.net`
   3. Save the file
2. In `.env.local` add the following lines <br />
   `HTTPS=true`<br />
   `HOST='local.santiment.net'`
3. Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
4. Create your own certificate authority on your system <br />
   `mkcert -install`
5. Create a certificate for your custom domain and concatenate the two files <br />
   `mkcert "127.0.0.1" "localhost" "local.santiment.net"` <br />
   `cat *-key.pem *.pem > server.pem`
6. Create /.cert folder and move the server.pem file into it in app root directory
